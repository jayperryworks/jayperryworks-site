I can’t imagine what you’re going through right now. As of last week, there is not only the Trump administration’s immigration ban &mdash; effectively a Muslim ban in all but name &mdash; but also the deadly attack on the mosque in Quebec City. I feel so horrified, saddened, and frightened by it all that I can hardly process it. I can’t imagine what you’re feeling.

I just want to say that I’m so grateful to have you as my friends, my neighbors, and my compatriots. I’m here to stand with you, and, for whatever it’s worth, you have my support and advocacy wherever I can offer it. I also know there are many, many others who feel the same way I do. 

I’m not Muslim myself but I’ve been deeply inspired by Islam. Most of all, the Muslims around me have taught me so much about humility, service, compassion, and devotion to God. These are relationships I feel incredibly lucky to have.

So, friends, neighbors, fellow Americans: whatever you’re feeling right now, please know that you’re not fighting alone.
