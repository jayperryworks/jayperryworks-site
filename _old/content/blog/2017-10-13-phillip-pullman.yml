      [This interview piece in the Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/magazine/philip-pullman-returns-to-his-fantasy-world.html) is excellent. I’m a huge fan of the _Golden Compass/Northern Lights_ series and I was happy to find that Pullman himself seems like someone who’d be fun to get a cup of tea with.

      But most of all, I realized [this](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/15/magazine/15pullman2/15mag-15pullman-t_CA1-superJumbo.jpg) is very much how I hope to look when I’m 70. The wiry hair, the red sneakers, the rooms piled with books — I’ll take all of it, thanks.
