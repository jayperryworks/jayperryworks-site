      "Promises" are a part of the Javascript language that I've always had a
      hard time getting my head around, despite the fact I use them all the
      time. There's just something oddly magical about them to me and I'm not
      sure I've ever been completely clear on all the nuances of the Promise
      object as it has evolved. [This article on
      CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/understanding-async-await/) does a
      really nice job breaking down how the syntax works and what it all means.
      It's by [Sarah Drasner](https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com), who I'd say is
      one of the best Javascript teachers out there.
