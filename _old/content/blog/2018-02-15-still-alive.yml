      I ran across [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/sports/olympics/skeleton-ghana-jamaica.html) earlier about the friendship between two skeleton racers in the Olympics, one from Ghana, the other, Jamaica. It’s a great read, but I especially love this bit:

      > Akwasi Frimpong, 32... remembers thinking on \[his\] first run \[on the sled\]: "Oh, man, I’m going to die. You want to brake, but there are no brakes. If there was a button to press stop, I would have."

      > But then he got to the bottom nearly a minute later, alive, and recovered his athletic instincts.

      > "The competitiveness in you says why not go back up and make less mistakes and go even faster," he said.

      I wonder how many great inventions and accomplishments have happened after moments like that in human history? "Well, that was dangerous and terrifying... but I bet I can go faster."
