      I finished a new sketchbook last night! I've been meaning to make a new
      one for myself for awhile but kept get sidetracked on other things.
      Finally done.

      ...and I had this handmade swirly paper on the closet, which I've used
      often for endpapers.

      The endpapers, glued in place. Unfortunately that paper is pretty thin so
      it wrinkled when I brushed on the glue, even though I tried really hard to
      use the glue really sparingly. Oh well.

      Finished! I thought I'd try a midtone paper for this sketchbook, so I
      could draw with black ink, as usual, but also use white ink or crayon for
      highlights. I've always liked the look of midtone grounds and hope to
      experiment more with it here. We'll see.
