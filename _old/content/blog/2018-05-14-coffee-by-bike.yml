      Neat thing i discovered: this dude brews coffee in Boulder, CO and [delivers it by bike](https://thecoffeeride.com), come rain or shine… or [snow](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdNhx7EFvt0/).

      You can order a bag of coffee and the Caffeine Fairy will pedal over and leave it on your doorstep. That’s almost enough to make me move to Boulder.

      There’s a great article about the founder (and his sweet Olivetti bike!) on [Cycling Tips](https://cyclingtips.com/2018/05/bikes-of-the-bunch-olivetti-bicycles-more-cowbell/).
