      Designer Tobias van Schneider posted a [really interesting post-mortem reflection on his ".Mail" email client project](http://www.vanschneider.com/story-dotmail).

      I remember seeing his concepts for the app back in 2010 or so, and they were really brilliant. You can see a lot of ideas in there that have become standard in modern email clients: swiping for actions, simplified account sidebar, avatars/social integration, and lovely minimalist type treatments. His case study/pitch was the first place I’d seen them; I can’t say for sure he invented those UI patterns, but they certainly weren’t common before. As a product it may have failed to launch, but as a piece of UI design it was really influential.

      This was also shortly before [Sparrow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparrow_(email_client)) got acquired by Google and then killed, and I remember desperately hoping .Mail would take off so the world [^1] would once more have a usable email client. I signed up for the email list and checked the case study occasionally, hoping to see an _Available now!_ callout appear there.

      Sadly, email protocols and APIs are a quagmire of sadness and despair and knashing of teeth, and it was not to be. But many of van Schneider’s ideas were picked up/stolen/borrowed by Dropbox, Spark, Polymail, etc., and we now have at least a few pretty great email clients, perhaps with .Mail to thank for it.

      Also, Tobias van Schneider has perhaps [the most amazing beard](http://www.vanschneider.com/bio) in the design industry.

      [^1]: Okay, by "world" I mean "me."
