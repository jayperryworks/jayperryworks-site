      If I’m ever in Minneapolis, visiting [Birchbark](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/books/birchbark-minneapolis-native-american-books.html) will be at the top of my list. It’s a local bookstore founded by one of my favorite authors, the legendary [Louise Erdrich](https://www.harpercollins.com/author/cr-100712/louise-erdrich/), and it sounds wonderful. It sells all kinds of books but specializes in Native American authors and culture, including a wide selection of language instructional books, including Ojibwe, Dakota, Lakota, and Inuktitut.

      I can imagine that when you walk in the place smells like wood and ink and new paper and maybe coffee. Just as a perfect bookstore should.

      I’ve grown up with Erdrich’s work; _The Master Butcher’s Singing Club_ is a book that means a lot to me which I’ve returned to a few times over the years. It’s hard to sum up how her work has affected me but, at the very least, her stories have taught me a lot about what it means to be American and how that notion is both more complex and more simple than it may seem. I dunno. Just read her stuff, you’ll see. Or, better yet, visit her store.
