      With a macro lens, a lot of blocks, and a lot of time, photographer
      Dominic Fraser made [this lovely series of
      images](https://petrolicious.com/articles/meet-the-man-who-turned-group-b-quattro-photos-into-lego)
      reproducing classic images of Audi rally cars.


      My favorite detail is that the spectators seem to have period-correct 80s hairdos.
