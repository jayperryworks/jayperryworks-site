      I’m excited about this: “[Luna Display](http://blog.astropad.com/using-luna/)” is a new hardware piece from Astropad, allowing you to use your iPad as a Cintiq-like second display with a Mac.

      I’ve used [Astropad](http://astropad.com) for a long time, and it’s fantastic. It’s one big limitation, though, is that it mirrors the Mac display rather than extend it. When I’m working, I really like to have reference imagery up on the main display to glance at, and looks like Luna would actually make this possible.
