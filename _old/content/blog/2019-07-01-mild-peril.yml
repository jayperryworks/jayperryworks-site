      I watched an [animated movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_(2008_film)) with my 4-year-old daughter tonight and, as it started, I noticed the MPAA rating as it flashed by: RATED ‘G’ FOR MILD PERIL. For some reason the phrase MILD PERIL got stuck in a kind of processing loop in my head. Maybe because I’ve always thought of peril as a binary state: either I’m in peril or I’m, you know, okay. I never really thought of it as something that needed to be quantified.

      So what does it mean to find oneself in 'mild' peril? As I considered this question, I realized that I would be helpless to stop myself from spending the rest of this movie devising Peril Scales. Like this:

      - **Mild peril**: We’re out of coffee.
      - **Moderate peril**: We’re out of water.
      - **Severe peril**: We’re out of air.

      Or maybe:

      - **Mild peril**: Angry badger.
      - **Moderate peril**: Angry wolverine.
      - **Severe peril**: Angry elephant.

      Or maybe:

      - **Mild peril**: [Sir Robin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYFefppqEtE).
      - **Moderate peril**: [Sir Lancelot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZbG7iwRh34).
      - **Severe peril**: [The Black Knight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35rVw1zskA). (Alright, we’ll call it a draw.)

      You get the idea.

      By the end of our movie, the main characters had been close enough to an exploding car to lose eyebrows and/or hearing, nearly run over by a delivery truck and _then_ a train, and were nearly killed in a burning building. If the MPAA calls that 'mild' peril, then I'd say best not to find yourself in a bar fight with any of their voting members.

      But whatever. My daughter loved the movie, and now we have something to watch that isn't _Frozen_.
