  A little while ago, my wife did a science experiment for our daughter: she put white carnations in water with a few drops of food-coloring in each, and left them to sit a few days. Slowly, the petals began to change color to match the water the stem was sitting in.

  I liked the scene on our kitchen counter and drew it, but in my version I used the colors of printing ink: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.
