  My wife and I were on a weekend trip to the Laurel Highlands in Pennsylvania, visiting some Frank Lloyd Wright houses, and found ourselves rambling around in the snow in the surrounding hills. Just past a bend in the road, there was a short cliff with a spectacular waterfall– frozen solid.

  This was originally a mural-size acrylic painting on three panels which took me 3 years to finish. Later, I had a high-resolution scan done and developed a print edition.
