  headline: I'm an independent designer, illustrator, and&nbsp;writer living near Baltimore.
  blurb: |-
    I do a bunch of different things and probably have too many preoccupations. But all my work boils down to roughly the same thing: putting bits and pieces together to tell a story &mdash; that is, a structure that takes you from one place to another. With, ideally, some good views along the way.

      I make pictures. Often more slowly than I'd like. Putting pencil to paper — dragging it around and leaving a mark behind — is a simple act that, in theory, precludes thought. But instead it stirs up endless anxieties and joys and fixations in me and this is probably why I can’t work faster. Nonetheless, leaving one mark always makes me want to leave another.

      And so: on to the next one.

    blurb: |-
      I've been designing things for about 20 years. My first gig was a website for an employment office in my hometown. I was lucky to get that job, and I’ve been lucky ever since; I’ve worked with many clients who do great work that I'm proud to contribute to.

      Along the way I’ve followed a winding path, but branding and interaction design have become specialties. I especially love the way that branding and user experience influence one another, and I love building a brand concept out into a living design system.
