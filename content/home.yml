  headline: I'm an independent designer, illustrator, and writer.
  blurb: |-
    For the last 20 years I've developed [user interfaces, publications, and brands](/design) for clients all over the world. I also like to write [essays](/longform/2022/patapsco/1) and make [prints](/pictures). I have a lot of interests, but a common thread for me is assembling bigger stories from many small details. I love to connect dots and find new relationships.

    blurb: |-
      An illustrated essay about Patapsco Valley State Park. This forest has been a constant in my life since I first stumbled into Baltimore as a student. Now I find myself introducing it to my daughter.

    blurb: |-
      I make pictures. Often more slowly than I'd like. Putting pencil to paper — dragging it around and leaving a mark behind — is a simple act that, in theory, precludes thought. But instead it stirs up endless anxieties and joys and fixations in me and this is probably why I can't work faster. Nonetheless, leaving one mark always makes me want to leave another.

      And so: on to the next one.

    blurb: |-
      My first gig was a website for an employment office in my hometown. I was lucky to get that job, and I've been lucky ever since; I've worked with many clients who do great work that I'm proud to contribute to.

      Along the way I've followed a winding path, but branding and interaction design have become specialties. I especially love the way that branding and user experience influence one another, and I love building a brand concept out into a living design system.
