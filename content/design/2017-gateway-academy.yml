      Gateway Academy was an e-learning platform designed to help banks in Sub-Saharan East Africa implement better financial support for their poorest customers.

      Developed under partnership with several other companies, we built a complex, robust digital product over several years using modern processes: rapid prototyping, agile development, styleguide-driven design, etc. Despite the NGO context and large number of stakeholders, our process and culture resembled a small startup.

      In my art-direction role, I led a small team responsible for UX/UI design, front-end development, and branding. We began our alpha prototyping in early 2017, with content models and wireframe prototypes. A bit later we created a component library and styleguide to help the development team build coded prototypes. As we evolved the branding and visual design, we evolved the styleguide and UI library in parallel.

      Over several years of continuous development, my design team built a comprehensive styleguide to document the brand, tone and voice, workflow, and our ever-evolving library of UI components.
