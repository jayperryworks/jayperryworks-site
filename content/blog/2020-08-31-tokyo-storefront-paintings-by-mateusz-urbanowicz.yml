      I'm always drawn to work that feels both intricate and gestural, a balance
      I keep grappling with in my own stuff. [These
      illustrations](https://abduzeedo.com/digital-watercolor-paintings-tokyo-storefronts)
      really nail that. They are precise and clear but not fussy, and unafraid
      to be imperfect.


      I'm not sure what tools the artist is using, but my guess is Procreate on an iPad? I'd love to learn more about how he achieves such lovely wet-brush watercolor effects digitally.
