      [Diwali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali) is this week! I love the symbolism of the ‘festival of lights’ and find the tradition incredibly beautiful and inspiring.

      One of my favorite bits of verse is from a Sanskrit hymn called _Jyota se jyota_, which Diwali often reminds me of.

      _Mera antara timira mitavo_<br>
      _Sadguru jyota se jyota jagavo_

      Loosely translated, that is:

      _Remove the darkness covering my heart_<br>
      _Light my light with yours, Lord_

      Those two short lines strike me as one of the most profound and sincere prayers I’ve ever heard, and I try to remember them often. May we all see by one another’s light this week.
