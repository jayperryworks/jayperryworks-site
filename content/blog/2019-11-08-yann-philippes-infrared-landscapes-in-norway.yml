      Photographer [Yann Phillipe](http://www.yannphilippe.com/infrared/) made this [series of landscapes](https://mossandfog.com/2019/10/28/brisk-norway-landscapes-transformed-with-infrared/) which are rendered using the infrared light spectrum, rather than visible light. The effect is dreamy and almost science-fiction-ey; forests become bright red while blues seem to get cooler.

      I'm not sure if these images were shot on actual [infrared film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_photography), or if he was using a [filter to simulate the effect](https://kolarivision.com/the-irchrome-infrared-photography-filter-our-digital-version-of-kodak-aerochrome/). As I understand, infrared film stock is _really_ hard to find these days (which is a shame), so my guess is that these images are digital. Either way, they're gorgeous.
