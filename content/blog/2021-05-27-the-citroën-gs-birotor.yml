      Citroen](https://petrolicious.com/articles/an-afternoon-with-the-citroen-\
      gs-birotor-a-wankel-powered-rarity-that-shouldnt-exist) combines my two
      favorite kinds of automotive-design crazy: Citroen quirk (one-spoke
      steering wheel, super weird suspension, black-swan-beautiful styling) with
      Wankel engines."
