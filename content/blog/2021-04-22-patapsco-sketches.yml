      We parked across the street from the entrance to the Cascade Falls trail
      in Patapsco State Park. My 5-year-old daughter, Evelyn, unfolded herself
      from her car seat and we began our ritual adumbrations with bags and
      snacks and water bottles and cameras and toys. Holding hands, we crossed
      the road and found the trailhead: an arched doorway to the forest, formed
      of branches and thorns. I ducked through, dropped off the edge of the
      asphalt onto a sunken path, turned, and held out my hand.


      Evie hesitated, then took a cautious first step, unsure of her legs grown too long, too fast.


      A few steps farther and the noise and heat and sunlight that baked us in the street were reduced to a hush, much the way the city is silenced as you walk through the front door of an old church. The stone walls and dusty shafts of sunlight reduce the bustle outside to a memory of a faraway place. You hear only the silence ringing, the minor-key echoes of centuries of prayer. A forest is the same: a natural cathedral built by (and from) billions of organisms simple and complex, working in a community of silence. Sunlight is scattered and tinted green and precipitated among the shadows. There’s nothing I find more calming. I’m home.

      It was a nice day and the trails were crowded. Other voices emerged in
      glimmers around us. The wristwatch-ticking of bicycle freewheels wound
      their way along adjacent trails. Birdsong was draped like ribbons between
      the tree branches.


      Another voice was Evie's, persistent beside my elbow. She had questions: concerning the cars, bicycles, pedestrians, dogs, squirrels, birds, trees, signs, flowers, and bugs we'd seen so far. I struggled to answer each as they tumbled endlessly out of her. She always expected an answer. Yet the stimuli-process-query loop ran so fast through her hyper-metabolic, preschooler head that I could hardly begin to address one question before the next began. We'd hiked a total of fifty feet and it'd taken a solid fifteen minutes of breathless discussion to get this far.


      But she was asking questions, and that, I reminded myself, meant she was _interested_. I felt relief and delight. I hadn't realized, until we've finally gotten here on this lovely Sunday, how much I needed her to understand what I saw in this place.


      I have some history with this forest. I've been returning here, for better and worse, for more than twenty years. This forest has, in a sense, raised me. Now I found myself introducing it to my daughter.


      There is a fear that I presume most parents share[^1]: that your child will be so different from you that you'll never truly connect. You'll love them no matter what; you know that to be true. But a part of you &mdash; perhaps the more selfish part &mdash; also wants to find common ground. You want a shared interest, something to talk about, some private ritual, some inside joke; something to reinforce the genetic lifeline between you. You hope that when their adult selves come home, thirty years from now (when they step off the train or airplane or spacecraft or whatever they've got by then), that the connection remains stronger than merely the nose or eyes or freckles you share.


      That part of me, perhaps the more selfish part of me, really needed Evelyn to love this forest.


      [^1]: I hope it's not just me.

      I discovered Patapsco Valley State Park when I was in college. I attended
      UMBC, a campus of the University of Maryland just down the road from the
      start of the Soapstone Trail in the park's Avalon area. I have a vague
      memory of driving by the trailhead one day, there on Rolling Road. 


      Trailheads, I'd like to think, are the same everywhere. I recognized the muddy, improvised “parking lot” crowded with bike-rack-laden pickups, and I felt an old curiosity. I grew up running and biking in the forests of the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, and roadside trailheads were a common-enough sight there. The more cars you saw, the better the trail was likely to be.


      When I moved into my dorm room at UMBC, three hundred miles away, I brought my running shoes with me. But they stayed in the closet awhile. I was impatient to discover a more worldly, urban, well-adjusted version of myself that I was quite sure was somewhere to be found in Baltimore. That meant leaving my Virginia self behind &mdash; or at least significant parts of it. I wasn't sure what parts, exactly, so to be safe I kept them all backstage and tried to render myself a clean slate. I was not going to be that careless, provincial kid loping around the ridges and hollows back home. I had put away childish things, as they say.

      But college and self-reinvention are stressful and the coping tools known
      to my 18-year-old self were perilously few. I casted about awhile for
      meaning and connection. I was too shy and prudish to take up drinking with
      my hallmates. The punk and hardcore music scenes, enjoying a small revival
      downtown, were a thing of wonder to me but too new and alien to be
      cathartic. A new friend even suggested I'd make a great "hooker" on his
      co-ed Rugby team (I decided to take this as a compliment), but after some
      [Googling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooker_(rugby_league)) I realized
      I'd be writing checks my scrawny body most definitely couldn't cash.


      So eventually I gave up and laced up my old shoes and started running again. For all the possibilities my new life in Baltimore seemed to provide, there was nothing that put my feet on the ground (so to speak) like running through a forest.


      One weekend, when I was twenty-ish, there was a snowstorm. A pretty big one: a good eight or so inches on the ground, and more falling rapidly. Usually I enjoy running in the snow and the notion must have struck me when I looked out the window. I would have been a sophomore or junior undergrad by then and I was probably procrastinating. Or I just needed fresh air[^1]. Either way, I kitted myself up and stepped out under the white sky.


      The powder floated around my feet. Cottony dust that squeaked and crunched as it compacted under each step. I'd planned to do my usual, out-and-back route on the roads near campus but the snow had made the world altogether less familiar. The landscape was draped in billowy whiteness but was also somehow easier to see, lacking in its usual shadows and dark undergrowth. There were almost no cars out, and the snowplows hadn't come through yet, so the road itself was a white river, a silent flow of ice crystals.

      I climbed the hill leading out of campus, the forest ahead. The cold air
      felt good in my throat as I warmed up. Blood began to flow properly: the
      chill no longer penetrated, my body radiated. The wind was calm: it
      brushed against my red cheeks. As I crested the hill and rounded the bend
      I saw the Soapstone trailhead on my right. Then another figure caught my
      eye: a silhouette in jacket and dark tights, running on the other side of
      the road from the opposite direction. A woman, youngish. Hair gathered
      carelessly under a beanie hat. She turned, crossed the road, and headed
      onto the trail. I waved and greeted her as she crossed my path. A runner
      in Catonsville was hardly an uncommon sight, but, somehow, seeing a
      kindred spirit out here in the snow was novelty enough to make shy people
      stop and chat. We were bonded by our lack of common sense.


      Instead of continuing on the road, I accompanied her down the trail awhile. She loped along the single-track with effortless grace, floating over all the snow-blind rocks and ruts I stumbled on. She crossed streams with an unbroken stride and dry feet. In the smoother sections (when I caught up), we talked about our running and training and the coaches we'd had along the way and, underneath the stories and memories, hopes and disappointments and limits. Bad days. Injuries. Small victories. 


      She was an altogether stronger, more serious runner than me and there we ran out of common ground quickly. But I recognized the same pressures in my own life. For a little while I could see the two of us there as if from high above: young people alone in an expanse of snow and bare trees, finding our way. Not knowing what we wanted, exactly, but asking for something more than mere survival. Enjoying the simplicity of being outside and moving our legs on a fine day like this.


      Eventually she took a turn onto a diverging path and, with a wave and a "nice talking with you," she melted into the trees and I never saw her again. I can't remember for sure but I don't think we'd even exchanged names. In the new-fallen snow it had perhaps seemed unnecessary: a certain anonymity to suit the unmarked winter canvas we found ourselves in. A chance to try out a different form of ourselves and see if it rang more true.

      Evelyn was fascinated by the creek that flowed alongside the Cascade Falls
      trail. She’s liked water ever since she was a baby. She liked to put her
      hands in it and watch it drip off her fingers. She liked to watch it pour
      and splash. She liked the way it filled an empty space. A few cups in the
      bathtub could occupy her for hours, until her tiny fingers were completely
      shriveled.


      At a spot where the trail and the creek met along a shallow, sandy bank, we stopped and knelt by the water’s edge. I scooped a rock out of the water and showed it to her. It was polished by the current, teardrop-shaped, with beautiful light-and-dark striation that made it seem as though the stone itself was flowing liquid. Evelyn held it in the light, looked at it closely, and asked me to get her another one.


      “Why don’t you try?” I prompted, pointing to the creekbed at my feet, the stones scattered and warped in the rivulets.


      She took a step toward the water and hesitated, nervous, caught in perhaps the most primal, human fear of them all: what lurks below the surface? We’re land creatures: scrawny, hairless bipeds designed for savannah. We’re out of our element but we’re drawn to water anyway.

      After some encouragement Evelyn took a step forward and reached into the
      current. She let her hand linger there a moment, enjoying the way the cool
      water flowed through her fingers. She picked up rocks, one after another,
      inspecting, commenting, trying to collect them all, but I made her put
      each back where she found it. Seizing on a Teachable Moment, I began to
      lecture: these are creatures' homes, leave no trace, erosion, geology,
      watershed, blah blah blah. 


      But she tuned me out, and interrupted my discourse with a counter offer: holding up a heaping handful, she pleaded to keep _just these_. We haggled, just as we haggle over brushing her teeth and putting away her toys. Eventually we reached a deal: she could pick out _one_ favorite and take it with her.


      Then I started wondering what was living in this creek. I lifted a bigger rock and peeked under it. Nothing there. I lifted another, waited for the dust to clear, and &mdash; there! Standing, frozen, on the muddy bottom, doing its absolute best to look like a stick or a leaf or a shadow or something that I &mdash; giant, looming predator that I was &mdash; would find unappetizing: a newt! 


      In whispers and slow movements, I pointed out the newt to Evelyn. This was, I think, the first time she'd seen one. The first time she'd seen anything alive in a creek.
  - type: passage

      It took a moment for her to fix her gaze on where I was pointing. I forgot
      how difficult a skill it is to learn to spot a creature in front of you
      that is talented at hiding. In the nature documentaries we watch on Disney
      (her favorites are the ones with cheetahs), the elusive and the
      camouflaged are betrayed for us in unmistakeable, high-definition clarity.
      We're given a reasonable approximation of the skilled eyes of veteran
      wildlife photographers. But here at this creek we had no such
      augmentation; our own eyes would have to do. When Evelyn finally saw our
      newt, she was transfixed. Questions &mdash; whispered under duress &mdash;
      poured out of her by the dozen.


      We turned over more stones, more and more, further and further into the deeper parts of the creek. Before she knew it, Evelyn found herself standing knee-deep in the water, her pink neoprene water shoes reduced to blurs under the foamy currents, her fears of the water and the mud and the dark crevices forgotten. Converted, in fact, into the kind of splashy, muddy, reckless eagerness that I dare say makes childhood worth remembering. We found minnows, crawdads, water-strider "Jesus" bugs, catfish (I think? It was too fast), and &mdash; best of all &mdash; tadpoles!


      Evelyn loves frogs. She desperately wanted to catch a tadpole and take it home. She yearned and pleaded, her eyes on the water, and suddenly I was twelve years old again, watching myself from above. I was in the creek in the pastures near my home in the Shenandoah Valley, net in hand, overturning rocks and dying to catch a frog. I was slow and clumsy and hesitant and therefore rarely successful, but even this was enough to populate half a dozen small terrariums in my bedroom with crawdads, salamanders, turtles, and fish. I did finally catch a frog &mdash; with the help of my friend Kyle, who had better reflexes[^1] &mdash; and proudly set him up in a small terrarium on my bookshelf. 


      It was a five-gallon-or-so plexiglass tank with a blue vented lid; I filled it about one-third full of water and placed a few rocks in the bottom to give my frog something to sit on. I placed him in the tank and sat back to admire my latest specimen. It eventually occurred to me that my frog might want to eat, and so I spent my evenings catching crickets near the basement door. I have no idea, to this day, if frogs actually like crickets, but mine would jump and catch them anyway, most of the time. Perhaps because he was confined to a tiny space with nowhere to hide and nothing that felt natural, or perhaps just because he was really hungry. I don't know, and I hate the fact that, back then, I'm not sure I particularly cared. The frog was, to me, a curiosity to study and enjoy; a decoration in my room. Having some sense for how the frog felt about it all was beyond me.


      Eventually I got tired of cleaning the tank and catching food, and I carried the frog back down to the creek and gently tipped him into the water in a deeper section near the bridge. I vividly remember the way that my frog swam out to the center of the water and floated there on the surface, idly, like a human sprawled on a floatie in a pool. He'd become too accustomed to the aquarium, I realized, where there was an absence of cover, but also an absence of hawks and snakes. 


      Before, this frog had been fast and alert; catching him had been difficult. Now I watched his pale, splayed-leg form, utterly exposed in the deep water, and I could finally feel a little of the consequence of my acquisitive "love" for wildlife.


      As I've grown older, I've come around to the perspective that animals should be appreciated right where they are. Humans should carry cameras, not cages. There is no need to recreate nature; it's already there, right in front of us. This was, at least, what I found myself trying to explain to Evelyn and, in turn, to my twelve-year-old self. Just being here, experiencing this creek, is enough. Your wet feet and the rippling water and the cool air and the dappled shade and the joy of discovering a newt in a crevice under a rock. These are the things worth keeping.


      I handed Evie my phone so she could take pictures, and we looked for more tadpoles.


      [^1]: For the record, we caught two frogs that day, so Kyle and I each got one to keep. He was a good friend like that, an uncommonly generous twelve-year-old.

      I remember when my wife, Jackie, and I started dating, we would often walk
      around the nearby lakes in Columbia. She would stop to look at flowers and
      plants, sometimes commenting, most often not. A kid raised in 4H, a
      denizen of state fairs and winner of blue ribbons in horticulture, she
      learned the names of things and remembered them perfectly into adulthood.
      I would ask what a particular tree was and, after a moment's inspection of
      its leaves or flowers or bark, she would rattle off its name. I learned
      from her that Howard County is filled with tulip poplars, that willows
      don't actually "weep" until maturity, and that maples inhabit the earth in
      apparently countless variety.


      To me this was a glorious magic trick. I didn’t know the names of things. 


      As I grew older and became a parent, I wished, with increasing desperation, that I commanded a deeper catalog of proper nouns. I didn't know the names of trees. I didn't know the names of plants, flowers, birds, or clouds.


      I could, once, identify turtles and frogs and salamanders and snakes pretty well, but I didn't retain them. These days I can tell your basic bullfrog from a spring peeper, or a terrapin from a box turtle, but those are pretty obvious. I used to know the different types of toads and salamanders, or how to identify a leopard frog as male or female, but those more subtle, intimate details have long been lost, I suppose, in the same dark corner of my mind now occupied by the latinate dinosaur species I'd memorized as a kid.


      My brain, for some reason, tends to remember the shapes of things. Only their shapes. It seems to note, more or less automatically, the way the light spills over a form, its proportions, lines, weight, highlights, and shadows. It'a often easier for me to draw a picture than it is to recall a name or location. 


      I used to treasure and protect this quirk in my wiring. Traipsing around Baltimore as a young art student, camera around my neck, I was mesmerized by the way the sunlight drew its severe triangles in the alleyways downtown, the way it threw the shadows of pedestrians onto the sidewalks, the way it lit up manikin faces in plate-glass storefronts.

      I remember gliding past all this, snapping my shutter, and feeling a
      conflicted mixture of desires: to absorb but also to stay at arm’s length.
      I had the sense that knowing my surroundings too well might somehow
      prevent me from capturing them properly in my viewfinder, as though my
      vision were powered by some kind of mystic ignorance. 


      _Draw what you see_, my art teachers used to intone, _not what you _think_ you see_. Therefore, not knowing &mdash; moving through life as an eternal passer-by &mdash; was, I imagined, the only way I could truly see the world beyond the presumptions and blind spots that familiarity cultivates. 


      Thoughts get in the way of seeing; an empty mind sees for the first time.


      I had a point. And yet, inevitably, life and middle age conspired to make me deeply familiar with many things. You simply cannot spend so many years walking the same path without eventually getting to know all the things along it, if not by name then at least by shape and habit. I know my house and my yard and the roads around my neighborhood. I know most of my neighbors’ dogs. I could write volumes about Jackie’s love for half-skim ricotta cheese; her collection of record players; the way she folds her pants; the way her hair changes from strawberry blonde in the summer, to red in the fall, to a rusty brown in winter; and the paradoxical way that she hates cold weather but loves glaciers and tundra. 


      My ignorance offered a certain clarity of vision, it's true. But these days it also strikes me as a fundamentally selfish way of seeing the world. You can see the shapes of things, but only that. Only the surface, the way the light is bent and reflected. You cannot see relationships, the way creatures and things fit into (indeed, _become_) their environments, or the way they change over time. You cannot see their joys or their suffering. You cannot help them or offer them anything because you have nothing to offer.


      You can only take: you capture their likeness with accidental insight.


      Understanding, on the other hand, demands time and energy and, finally, compassion. You put in the effort and you accept the risk that your first impression will be lost, changed into something you know all too well and which you perhaps can no longer really see. But what you gain is genuine connection: you enter into relationship.


      Somehow, I want to learn to do both: to see with an empty mind, but also to see with the deep understanding of time and familiarity. That is perhaps impossible, but I suppose I’ll have really gotten there &mdash; wherever _there_ is &mdash; when I can look at a rock, a tree, a dog, a neighbor, and see our entire shared lives as if for the first time. 


      And then there is Evelyn. She sees everything for the first time, quite literally. Walking along beside her, on this trail, I watch her experience the same things I did when I wasn’t much older. She wants to know the names of things because it is all new and wondrous and sometimes a little scary. I watch from above, and this, I’m realizing, is what fatherhood seems to boil down to: watching my childhood a second time, from a different vantage. It is a chance to remember and a chance, perhaps, to see that my mistakes and fears are not so unique. This other person is having them right now, all over again.


      In that sense, it is also a chance to forgive myself.


      You cannot have a child, I’ve discovered, without realizing the depth of your connection to your ancestors and your collective past. You are no longer a leaf on the great tree; you are a branch, part of the wood that goes all the way down to the deepest, strongest roots. A tree as old as memory itself, but always growing.


      Perhaps it is this constant growth &mdash; time itself &mdash; that is the answer to my riddle: you cannot put your hand in the same river twice, as they say. No matter how familiar a place may feel, it is nonetheless always changing, always "new". 


      In that way, we are seeing for the first time, always.

      All too soon it was time to head home. By now we'd made it all the way to
      Cascade Falls, and Evelyn was splashing around in a swirling, rock-rimmed
      pool at the base of the waterfall. There was a smile etched on her face,
      mud on her shorts, and she was knee-deep in creek water she'd found
      frightening an hour ago. I watched her from the water's edge and took
      pictures. Watching my best childhood memories from the outside. I hoped
      that Evie would keep a few of her own.


      Gradually, I coaxed her out of the water and we hiked back to the car. She stopped random people, along the way, to invite them to her pool by the falls, and to tell them about the tadpoles. She didn't want to leave and she fussed about this. But my girl burns calories like a steam engine burns coal[^1], and her increasing hangry-ness was precisely the reason we needed to go. She'd eaten all the snacks I'd brought, and she needed dinner and a bath and some sleep. Tomorrow was a school day, and so now, I &mdash; the adult in the picture, once more &mdash; had to pull her back into that world of obligation and schedules. But we'd managed to lose ourselves for several hours in this cathedral of trees, this place of silence and curiosity, and perhaps that was enough to last us.


      Strapped into her car seat and sating herself with handful after handful of cheese crackers, Evie grew thoughtful a moment. Then she asked me the question I'd been dying to hear:


      "Can we come back tomorrow?"
