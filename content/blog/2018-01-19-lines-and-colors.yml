      This is [a really lovely blog of painting and illustration](http://linesandcolors.com/).

      I like to look at it every morning because it makes for a wonderful few minutes of peace and inspiration. And the notes on technique and history are really great - I’ve discovered lots of artists here I’d never heard of.

      The work shown is usually quite traditional, broadly in the figurative, landscape, and still-life veins, but I really appreciate that no lines are drawn around canon figures; editorial and advertising illustration is happily showcased alongside museum-vaunted artists like Monet and Rembrandt. The author seems interested in great lines, brushwork, and color wherever they find it — and their mining has surfaced some amazing diamonds.
