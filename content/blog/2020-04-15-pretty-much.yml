      The other day I was sitting on our deck with my 4-year-old daughter, Evelyn. She saw a bee fly by.

      "What bee is that?" She asked.

      "I'm not sure," I replied, "a carpenter bee, I think?"

      "I mean, did that bee have a name?" she asked.  "I guess bugs don't have names," she continued after a moment, "they’re just ‘bee.’"

      "Well, maybe each bee buzzes in a slightly different way. Maybe bees can distinguish different kinds of buzzing, and that's how they recognize one another."

      Evie considered this. "Is that true?"

      "I don't know," I said, "I'm just speculating. Do you know what _speculating_ means?"

      "It means... you're just making stuff up?"
