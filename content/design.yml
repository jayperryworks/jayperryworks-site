title: Design work
intro: |-
  I have a broad background, a result of both curiosity and necessity. I like working with small teams, and I’ve often worn extra hats that the budget couldn’t fill. That suites me fine: I like hats, and I like to find patterns in complex processes. While user interface design and branding are my main focuses these days, I also have experience in publication design, print and environmental design, advertising, video and broadcast, and education.

  In addition to my design work, I’m a front-end coder. I love Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I advocate for semantics; inclusive accessibility; speed; and device-agnostic, responsive layouts. I tend to see my coding work as a natural extension of my design process. I like to “explore” with code via prototypes, and I love using styleguides and design systems to build consensus on complex projects.

  title: Selected clients
  intro: |-
    I’m located in the Baltimore-DC metro area and, being near the U.S. government, I’ve ended up working frequently with nonprofits and NGOs. I’ve also worked with a number of startups, small businesses, and tech- and entertainment-industry folks. I’m very, very lucky to have had the chance to work with so many organizations I admire, and to contribute, in some small way, to their missions.

    Here’s a few clients I’ve worked with over the years, as part of various teams and agencies:
  items:
    - Discovery Communications
    - World Wildlife Fund
    - Defenders of Wildlife
    - World Bank Group
