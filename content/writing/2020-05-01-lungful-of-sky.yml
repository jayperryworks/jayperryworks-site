      One night a few weeks ago, we were planning dinner. I volunteered for taco night, but, opening the fridge, I realized we were out of shredded cheese and refried beans. There were a few other basics we could use, so I decided to make a run to the grocery store. On a whim, I decided to ride my bike.
      
      It was already 9. I hadn't ridden at night in some time; the prospect of riding in the dark always left me a little apprehensive. But lately the relentless juggling of work and childcare (daycare, of course, is closed) has left little space for exercise during the day. Or anything else, really. So this errand, however short, seemed like a good enough opportunity to get some fresh air and move my legs.

      I put on my backpack and pulled a fleece gaiter around my neck (we hadn't had a chance, yet, to make proper masks). I hauled my bike down from its hook in the garage, clamped my headlight on the handlebars, and set out, a little nervous, into the dark at the end of the driveway.
      
      Once I was moving, though, the night opened up before me. As my eyes adjusted, the cloudless sky lightened from black to a cobalt as deep as the solar system itself. Soon enough I could see the dome of stars overhead, growing brighter alongside the crescent moon. The streets were deserted and silent. Silhouetted tree branches, adorned with muted flowers, a few chirping bugs, and some restless birds, framed the sky. The cool wind rushed by my face and hands, hummed in my ears.
      
      I arrived at the grocery store, pulled the gaiter up over my face, and made my purchases. The store was a jumpy and overstimulated place, shockingly bright compared to the streets outside, each aisle bathed in unrelenting fluorescence but, nonetheless, filled with blind corners and tight spaces. I sidestepped other customers, my back against the opposite shelves, their faces erased by masks, their eyes moving quickly over me and then up and down the aisle. With every turn, a chance to walk into a sneeze, a cough, a lingering exhaled breath, an invisible cloud of infected droplets that could end your story right here.
      
      Back outside, I unlocked my bike and put my helmet back on. I was standing under the outside portico, lit by the same fluorescent tubes as the inside. It glowed greenishly against the surrounding darkness. Jumbled rows of waiting shopping carts cast thorny, twisted shadows on the concrete. A couple of the store’s workers leaned against the wall nearby, having a smoke break. They chatted absently about shifts and scheduling and kids and bills, their masks, unfastened, hanging loosely against their collarbones. Their cigarette smoke rose and curled in the air below the lights overhead. It was exhaled breath, made visible for a moment, which we all now feared.
      
      One of them nodded to me, smiled, and wished me a good night. I wanted to voice my gratitude, somehow, and I hesitated a moment, searching for words in my reply. Gratitude for... ? Their courage? Their patience? The hard, unrelenting shift work they risked their life to continue doing to help feed the rest of us? Yes to all of that. But I also think it's easy to make unhelpful assumptions about the (usually complex) motivations of others; to paint them in your own colors for your own purposes. They were, above all else, hourly employees, under obligation to their landlords and mortgage lenders and childcare providers, probably without enough safety net in the way of paid leave or benefits. Heroism, so often, appears in the form of the everyday and the necessary.
      
      So what was I trying to thank them for? Everything I started to say, on playback in my tired, prickly mind, sounded presumptuous or self-serving. They weren’t here for me. They were here to feed their kids and pay their bills.
      
      Instead I simply smiled back and said thank you, have a good night yourselves. In the end I could only offer them basic courtesy: the normalcy of passing small talk. I see you there, neighbor, under your mask. It wasn’t enough, but it was all I had.
      
      As I pedaled out of the parking lot I took deep gulps of the fresh night air. That clear, cobalt sky, filling my lungs. The wind scouring me. The nervous energy in my back and legs draining away as I spun up one hill after another, breaking a sweat against the chill, the heavy backpack against my shoulders. It felt so good, for a few minutes, to have a body and really use it for something.
      
      Passing an entrance to a diverging bike path, I paused. All the work of my day was done, my family in bed. For once, no one was waiting for me. I could take that turn and ride for hours if I liked. This trail led down to some nice lakes and forests that I used to visit often. I bet they were just as lovely on a clear night like this. But I also felt the tiredness of the day pulling at me, making itself known in my joints.
      
      Another night, I told myself. I continued home, instead, the worries in my mind still there, but a little quieter under the sound of the wind. It wasn't enough, but it helped.
