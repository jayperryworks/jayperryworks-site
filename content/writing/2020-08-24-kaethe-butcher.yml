      I really like artist [Kaethe Butcher's figurative ink
      drawings](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2020/08/kathe-butcher-illustrations/https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2020/08/kathe-butcher-illustrations/).
      I've found myself staring at them awhile today. She has this wonderfully
      expressive, loose-but-precise linework, and I love the way she uses tone
      and contrast - both spare and dramatic. 


      She mentions in her [bio](https://www.kaethebutcher.com/about) that she's a fan of [Austrian Expressionist painter Egon Schiele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egon_Schiele), and I think I can see his influence. But while Schiele's work has often struck me as clinical - if not deliberately lifeless or grotesque - Butcher's work seems much more intimate, more connected with her subjects as people. She's struck a nice balance between being formally interesting and also being emotionally compelling - that is, between being a good _drawing_ and a good _portrait_, which Lord knows is not easy.
