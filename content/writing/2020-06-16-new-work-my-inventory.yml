    markdown: "I've been working on a new series of small drawings of things my
      daughter and I have found around our neighborhood this spring. With
      everybody stuck at home, Evelyn and I gradually stumbled into a daily
      ritual. We'd take the dog out for a walk each afternoon, and we'd talk
      about the things we saw changing around us: the flowers blooming and
      falling, the leaves growing, the colors changing, the bugs and birds and
      chipmunks re-emerging as the weather turned warmer. Evelyn would come home
      with her pockets stuffed with whirligigs and buttercups and cicada shells,
      which she'd arrange in little taxonomic collections around the house."

    markdown: Time to concentrate has been in short supply in lockdown, and I've had
      to put some of my bigger projects on hold while I've been treading water.
      One day I stumbled across a collection of James Audubon's bird drawings
      and I remembered how much I loved his work - I love its simple
      sophistication, its clarity, and how it so adeptly served as both
      scientific documentation and personal journal.

      On that inspiration I started sketching the bits of "neighborhood
      ephemera" Evie compiled. I settled on a simple pattern: one subject, in
      black-and-white ink wash over an empty background; a square frame; and a
      small, handwritten caption nearby. These drawings are simple enough that I
      can usually finish one in a single day. That momentum is really
      satisfying, especially right now when I find it so easy to feel
      overwhelmed by everything else.


      As I finish more of these drawings, I think I'll start arranging them on our bedroom wall as a kind of inventory of memories. These drawings are a lot of fun and I hope to keep doing them, off and on, for a long time to come. I hope they accumulate into the hundreds.

    markdown: Likewise, I plan to edition these drawings as small, relatively cheap
      prints (probably 6 x 6"), so they can be collected and displayed in a grid
      or row or whatever arrangement you like. Stay tuned; Iâ€™ll update this post
      once the first few are available.
