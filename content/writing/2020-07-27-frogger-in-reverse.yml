      I almost ran over this poor toad when I was out on a bike ride one night.
      I enjoy evening rides on the bike paths around my town, but on summer
      nights there are often so many toads hanging out on the path that I have
      to slow down and thread my way around them. It's like a game of
      [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger), but in reverse.


      The toads seem surprisingly unconcerned with either my bike's crushing tires or with the close proximity of giant human predators. This one sat there calmly as I took a picture of him. 


      And so now I offer my tribute in ink: take care of yourself, brave toad.
