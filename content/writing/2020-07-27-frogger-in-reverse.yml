      I almost ran over this poor toad when I was out on a bike ride one night
      awhile ago. I enjoy riding on the bike paths around my town in the
      evenings, but after the sun sets there are so many toads hanging out on
      the path that I have to slow down and thread my way around them. It's like
      a game of [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger), but in
      reverse.


      The toads seem surprisingly unconcerned with either my bike's crushing tires or with the close proximity of giant predators like myself. This one sat there calmly as I took a picture of him. 


      And so now I offer my tribute in ink: take care of yourself, brave toad.
