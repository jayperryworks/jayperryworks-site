      Really nice to see more and more strong fonts being released under open-source licenses. This one is particularly lovely - I have a soft spot for these chunky humanist typefaces and I love the little details in this one, like the angle-cut terminals and the treatment of the lowercase "t".

      I hope the community keeps developing it; I'd especially love to see where they might go with additional weights and styles.
