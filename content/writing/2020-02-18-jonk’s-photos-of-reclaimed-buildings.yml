      I love these [photos of deteriorated buildings and cars and
      such](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2020/01/nature-reclaims-abandoned-structures-in-photographs-by-jonk/),
      gradually reverting to forest. Created by Parisian photographer
      [Jonk](http://www.jonk-photography.com/), who was inspired by nature
      documentaries.
