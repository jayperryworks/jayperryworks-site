      These [playgrounds by Danish architecture firm Monstrum](https://www.1843magazine.com/design/the-designers-having-fun-with-playgrounds) for the Lego House rooftop look amazing. These spaces look like a lot of fun, but I especially like that they suggest stories. A great place to play but also to pretend.
