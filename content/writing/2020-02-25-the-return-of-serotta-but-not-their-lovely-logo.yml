title: 'The return of Serotta, but not their lovely logo'

      A classic racing bicycle brand, Serotta, [is
      returning](https://cyclingtips.com/2020/02/after-years-in-the-wilderness-serotta-is-back/)!
      Known for their innovations in the use of titanium and their unique
      approach to bike fit, Serottas were a common sight at the front of major
      races around the world.


      One of my favorite things about them, however, was their beautiful
      logotype:

      Those angular letters look absolutely amazing on a down tube[^1].


      Sadly, it looks like they’ve [thrown this away](https://serotta.com).
      Their new logo is a bold, oblique, square sans-serif. Just like&hellip;
      every other sports company that exists today.


      I’m said about this not only because the original was such a lovely
      treatment but also because the modern bike industry is full of truly awful
      typography. Both mass-market and small-batch/custom companies sin in equal
      measure. This mystifies me a little because a bicycle is such an
      inherently graceful, elegant machine. The armchair-designer side of me
      thinks branding one might be easy: it’s already a handsome product. Just
      put some graceful, elegant lettering on there to match. But so many
      companies go instead for shouty billboard logos sprayed all over the
      frame.


      I know, of course, that A) making a bike is a huge engineering challenge
      and there are so many factors that go into making one that rides well and
      B) I no doubt sound like an old person grousing about something so
      superficial. But the designer in me gets a little heartbroken every time I
      see an otherwise fantastic bicycle with terrible frame decals. The poor
      thing deserves better.


      A few notable exceptions I’d like to shout out are
      [Mason](https://masoncycles.cc),
      [Ritchey](https://us.ritcheylogic.com/us_en/),
      [Allied](https://alliedcycleworks.com/pages/allied-alfa-allroad), and
      [All-City](https://allcitycycles.com/)[^2], which all have thoughtful,
      classic logos and frame graphics&mdash; a perfect finishing touch for the
      thoughtful, classic bikes they sell. Tip of the hat to
      [Trek](https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/) and
      [C&eacute;rvelo](https://us.ritcheylogic.com/us_en/), who both do the bold
      oblique thing but their lettering, at least, is nicely cut and
      applied.[^3]


      [^1]: Which, by the way, is the tube that runs diagonally from the ‘head
      tube’ (just above the front wheel) to the ‘bottom bracket’ (at the pedal
      axle). This is traditionally where bike manufacturer apply their logo
      decals.


      [^2]: I especially like that All-City give their bikes fantastic names
      like “Cosmic Stallion” and “Gorilla Monsoon.”


      [^3]: In C&eacute;rvelo’s case, their brand was recently facelifted by
      Canadian design agency Concrete. There’s a nice case study
