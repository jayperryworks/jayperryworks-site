      **Operator:** Maryland Poison Control, how can I help you?

      **Me:** Hi, my wife just got stung by a... _(scrolling through pictures on phone)_ 'saddleback moth' caterpillar and she's in a lot of pain. Do we need to go to urgent care?

      **Operator:** Well, it's usually not serious. It's painful but it rarely lasts more than a few hours. Use scotch tape to pull out the needles, wash with soap and water, and apply ice to reduce swelling. Benadryl will help with the irritation, Tylenol for pain.

      **Me:** Okay, great, thanks, we'll do that.

      **Operator:** No problem. Just for our demographic data, can I get some information?...

        _(asks a list of questions)_

        ... and how old is your wife?

      **Me:** "Well, funny you should ask. Today is her birthday.

      **Operator:** ...really?

      **Me:** _(sighs)_ Yes.

      **Operator:** _(laughing uncontrollably)_ ...um, happy birthday?

      **Me:** â€¦Thanks. The party never ends here.

      **Operator:** "Uh huh. Give her some Benadryl.

      **Wife (in background):** ASK HIM IF I CAN KEEP DRINKING.
