      Getting straight to the point, here's a few things I've been reading that
      I find helpful and insightful:


      - I love this piece that [**Stacey Abrams** wrote for the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/opinion/stacey-abrams-voting-floyd-protests.html) about how much voting matters right now. Sometimes the most basic things - the things easiest to overlook or take for granted - are what matter the most in dark times.

      - [**President Obama**’s piece](https://medium.com/@BarackObama/how-to-make-this-moment-the-turning-point-for-real-change-9fa209806067) about local politics and police reform is great - not only because it's insightful but also because his calm, clear, eloquent voice is so comforting to hear right now.

      -  **Neil DeGrasse Tyson** wrote a [powerful blog post](https://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/commentary/2020-06-03-reflections-on-color-of-my-skin.php) about his experiences with discrimination and police bias.

      - **Marques Brownlee**, a tech journalist and Youtuber I’ve followed for a long time, was inspired by Dr. Tyson’s article to [reflect on his own life experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-_WXXVye3Y&feature=youtu.be).

      - I found this [great list of resources and guidance for antiracist advocacy](http://bit.ly/ANTIRACISMRESOURCES).[^1]

      As a white person I believe I have a duty to recognize that my black and
      brown neighbors face a reality that is very different from my own, and I
      believe I have a duty to speak out against discrimination,
      disenfranchisement, police brutality, and white supremacy whenever I can.
      There is
      [significant](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/07/data-police-racial-bias),
      [compelling](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/soc/racepoliticsjustice/2017/08/24/the-harmful-effects-of-implicit-racial-bias-in-the-police/)
      [evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/upshot/surprising-new-evidence-shows-bias-in-police-use-of-force-but-not-in-shootings.html)
      that the police treat black people differently, nationwide. Until our
      police and legal system can operate without bias, and until we can provide
      true equality of opportunity for people of color, I fear we will never
      break this pattern. It’s on all of us to speak out, and [it’s on all of us
      to build a fairer
      system](https://medium.com/@BarackObama/how-to-make-this-moment-the-turning-point-for-real-change-9fa209806067).


      To my white readers: please consider advocating, in your own way, against systemic racism. An organization I like and support is [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/), a legal group that aims to stamp out white supremacy and protect marginalized communities nationwide. Another is [No Kid Hungry](https://www.nokidhungry.org/)[^1], a group that feeds children as a way of providing equality of opportunity. But I’m learning that there are [many ways to contribute and advocate](http://bit.ly/ANTIRACISMRESOURCES)[^2] and I hope you’ll join me in working to be a better neighbor and citizen.


      I can’t imagine the pain that George Floyd’s family is feeling right now. I pray that they will be able to find justice and closure. But most of all I pray that no one else has to suffer this fate.


      [^1]:	I discovered this organization thanks to a cyclist named Phil Gaimon, who has been fundraising for them through his [Youtube show](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqI9HyfLvodz7bXFCI3PU2g). His show is fantastic and hilarious. I’m a huge fan and you should watch it if you like bikes. You can donate through his fundraising program [here](https://p2p.onecause.com/chefscycle2020/phil-gaimon).
