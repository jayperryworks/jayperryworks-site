I ran across [this short film](https://vimeo.com/108650530) this morning. I saw this for the first time a couple years ago and it was really nice to watch it again.

I’ve been kind of obsessed with Carl Sagan for most of my life; Pale Blue Dot (the book the voiceover comes from) is an all-time favorite, one I reread more or less like it was scripture. Hearing his voice reading from it over these images honestly gets me a little choked up every time I watch it.

Also! There’s a [website with stills](http://www.erikwernquist.com/wanderers/film.html)!  I’ve found my new desktop wallpaper.
