      Oh dear Lord I want [this book](https://standardsmanual.com/products/parks).

      I remember those "Helvetica + black stripe" pamphlets and maps from my childhood (esp the Appalachian Trail and Shenandoah ones - which I think are still printed) - I had no idea that they were actually part of a giant design system developed by Massimo Vignelli’s studio.

      This is one of those connecting threads between my hayseed middle-of-nowhere childhood and the supposedly bigger world I’m aware of now that just kind of gives me chills.
