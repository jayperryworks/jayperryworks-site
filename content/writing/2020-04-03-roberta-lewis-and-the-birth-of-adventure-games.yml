      This [biography of game designer Roberta Williams](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/roberta-williams-is-the-worlds-first-graphic-computer-game designer-but-shes-famous-for-all-the-wrong-reasons/) is fascinating. I remember the King's Quest games from when I was a kid and I remember being awed by the graphics, especially the beautiful background scenery. I had no idea all those games came from the same designer.
