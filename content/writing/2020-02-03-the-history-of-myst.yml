      Ars Technica did [a wonderful interview with Rand
      Miller](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/video-how-mysts-designers-stuffed-an-entire-universe-onto-a-single-cd-rom/),
      one of the co-creators of Myst, a groundbreaking adventure game originally
      released in the 1990s.


      I've never been a great gamer; I really admire the craft and skill of
      _creating_ games but I rarely seem to have the patience, persistence, or
      problem-solving skills to truly engage with them beyond a superficial
      degree and as a result I rarely play them all the way through.


      That wasn't the case with Myst. I remember the first time I saw it: I went
      to my Dad's office with him one day. I was maybe 8 (I can't remember why).
      In the evening, as people were heading home and I was following him out
      the door, I saw a couple of his coworkers gathered around one of the
      computers. One of them was playing the game, while a few others looked
      over his shoulder. Dad and I stopped to watch a moment and I found myself
      glued to the floor, transfixed. The landscapes I saw, and the eery,
      beautiful sound design immediately blew me away. There was a story being
      told here, but it wasn't being fed to you in a linear way as a book or
      film would do. Instead it offered an open space to explore with its own
      history that you needed to uncover on your own.


      This was my first experience with non-linear narrative, and it made me
      think about software in a whole new way.


      I'd played plenty of video games before that day, but they'd been mostly
      limited to platform-jumping, obstacle-avoiding console games. Myst was
      very  different. It had very little animation â€“ owing to technical
      limitations - but its creators had used this as a design choice, creating
      this wonderful sense of stillness and quiet throughout the game. You were
      invited to move around slowly, and take in all the details. The graphics
      were so rich and beautiful that it was worth stopping to examine every
      scene. There were no pitfalls or enemies to avoid. You couldn't really
      "die" or "fail" because of a mistake (aside from one point near the end of
      the game). Instead, the challenge was to solve puzzles and connect the
      dots between all the different elements you encountered in each world.
      Your reward was, simply, another chapter of the story, and therefore more
      amazing things to see.
