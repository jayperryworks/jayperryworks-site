      I found a [specialty pen shop](http://www.penboutique.com) nearby, where I picked up this great Pilot Namiki fountain pen. Super smooth, and allows just a bit of modulation in the line, nice heft to it.

      My curiosity was inspired by cartoonist Dan Berry, who talks a bit about [his search for the perfect pen](http://www.thingsbydan.co.uk/2014/03/pens-pens-pens/) on his blog, ["Things by Dan."](http://www.thingsbydan.co.uk)

      I've always preferred drawing with brushes and have usually found pens difficult: it was hard for me to draw expressive lines with the felt tips I had laying around. I've also played with dip pens, but my drawing is a bit too impatient and sketchy and I usually end up just scratching holes in my paper.

      So I was really interested to hear that fountain pens offered more sensitivity. After playing with mine for an hour or so, I can already feel a difference. So, cheers, Dan Berry.

      Dan Berry also has a wonderful podcast called ["Make It Then Tell Everybody"](http://makeitthentelleverybody.com) which you should listen to immediately.
