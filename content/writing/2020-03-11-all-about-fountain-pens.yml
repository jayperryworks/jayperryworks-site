      I meant to post this a long time ago, but got distracted: [a nice piece in
      the Times about fountain pens and the community around
      them.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/style/fountain-pens.html)


      I work mostly with brushes and, uh, computers, but fountain pens are my
      favorite tool for making fine lines. When I’m inking a new drawing, I
      usually pick up a pen to finish it off. With the right nib, a fountain pen
      can be more expressive than a felt tip or ballpoint. Lines can be thinned
      or widened depending on pressure, or the angle of the pen. There’s a
      learning curve but in a practiced hand they offer a bit more control and
      subtlety. 


      But aside from all that, there’s something about fountain pens themselves
      that feels compelling. It’s just a thing that makes marks on paper, a
      pretty innocuous job that a chewed-up No. 2 pencil accomplishes just as
      well. A lovely pen somehow makes that simple act feel a little more
      special. I dunno: my wife and I have certain attachments to anachronisms
      like pens and vinyl records and canning jars and film cameras that make no
      sense but make life feel a little more interesting nonetheless. 


      It’s nice to see we’re not alone in that.
