      I really like the dense, chiaroscuro shadows in [these etchings by early
      20th-century illustrator Martin
      Lewis.](http://linesandcolors.com/2019/08/16/martin-lewis/ "Martin Lewis")
      He was a friend of Edward Hopper, and you can see similar glimmers of
      loneliness and impending drama in his wide-angle compositions.
